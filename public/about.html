<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Amir Khalil, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with two years of experience in creating dynamic and responsive websites and applications. I specialize in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and various database systems like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new tools and frameworks.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Lahore. What excites me the most about full-stack development is the opportunity to bring innovative ideas to life through code and the continuous learning that comes with it.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I enjoy bodybuilding, or reading tech blogs, which keeps me balanced and inspired. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me at amirkhalil468.ee@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn/GitHub/other platforms. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
